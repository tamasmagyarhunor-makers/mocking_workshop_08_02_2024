# {{Blender}} Class Design Recipe
## {{Fruit}} Class Design Recipe
Copy this into a `recipe.md` in your project and fill it out.

## 1. Describe the Problem

_Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have._
```
As a Blender
So that I can make juice
I want to be able to make juice with Fruits.
```
```
As a Fruit
So I can offer information about myself
I want to be able to have a name and a calory.
```

```
As a Blender
So that I can help people diet
I want to be able to calculate calory of a juice.
```
```
As a Business Stakeholder
I would like the Fruit class to return the calory of a Fruit as a String
So its more readable to our customers. eg. 'This [fruit_name] has [calory] calories'
```

## 2. Design the Function Signature

_Include the name of the function, its parameters, return value, and side effects._

```python
# EXAMPLE
class Blender():
    def __init__(self):
        self.storage = []

    def add_fruit(self, fruit):
        """It takes a fruit, and stores it in the storage.

        Parameters: (list all parameters and their types)
            fruit: a Fruit object

        Returns: (state the return value and its type)
            Nothing (None)

        Side effects: (state any side effects)
            It adds the item into the self.storage
        """
        pass # Test-driving means _not_ writing any code here yet.

    def make_juice(self):
        """Makes juice with the Fruit(s) in the storage

        Parameters: (list all parameters and their types)
           None 

        Returns: (state the return value and its type)
            String (eg. "orange juice")

        Side effects: (state any side effects)
            None
        """
        pass # Test-driving means _not_ writing any code here yet.

class Fruit():
    def __init__(self, name, calory):
        self.name = name
        self.calory = calory

    def get_name(self):
        return self.name
        """It takes no argument and returns a String.

        Parameters:
            None

        Returns:
            String (eg. "orange")

        Side effects:
            None

        """
    
    def get_calory(self):
        return f"This {self.name} has {self.calories} calories"
        """It takes no argument and returns an integer.

        Parameters:
            None

        Returns:
            integer (eg. 5)

        Side effects:
            None

        """
```

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of what the function will take and return._

```python
# EXAMPLE

"""
Given a Blender object is instantiated
It intantiates with an empty list.
"""
blender = Blender()

actual = blender.storage
expected = []

assert actual == expected


"""
Given a Blender puts a Fruit in the storage
The storage will contain the Fruit.
"""
blender = Blender()
fruit = Fruit('orange')
blender.add_fruit(fruit)
actual = blender.storage
expected = [fruit]

assert actual == expected
assert type(actual[0]) == Fruit

"""
Given a Blender makes juice
It returns a Fruit juice.
"""
blender = Blender()
fruit = Fruit('orange')
blender.add_fruit(fruit)
actual = blender.make_juice()
expected = "orange juice"

assert actual == expected

"""
Given a Fruit object is instantiated
It intantiates with a name.
"""
fruit = Fruit('apple', 10)

actual = fruit.get_name()
expected = 'apple'

assert actual == expected

"""
Given a Fruit object is instantiated
It intantiates with a name.
"""
fruit = Fruit('kiwi', 5)

actual = fruit.get_calory()
expected = 'This kiwi has 5 calories'

assert actual == expected




```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._

Here's an example for you to start with:

```python
# EXAMPLE



```

Ensure all test function names are unique, otherwise pytest will ignore them!
